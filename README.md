# CP1404 Practicals
## Prabhsher Singh

Welcome to my **CP1404 Practicals Repository**.
This repo contains my weekly practical exercises for the *Programming II* subject at James Cook University.

The goal of these practicals is to improve clean coding practices, develop structured and reusable code, and demonstrate understanding of programming fundamentals using Python.

## Key Lessons Learnt

- Following PEP8 conventions, using clear naming, and proper indentation to make code readable and professional.  
- Each function or class should do one thing well to make code easier to test and maintain.  
- Writing clear docstrings and comments helps others (and future me) understand the purpose of code quickly.
