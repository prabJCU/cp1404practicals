# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I put more time into understanding logic behind the tasks rather than just trying to get programs to run and call it a day.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still feel I can manage my time better, especially getting through weekly content early so more time can be spent on actual tasks.
I also need to be more consistent with my version control, particularly committing regularly (which I didn't do for the assignment).

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been improving my methods of actually learning and absorbing information. 
Week by week, I am gaining confidence in understanding material and applying it.
In turn, this has made me improve at writing code that is clean while following style guides.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Avoid rushing through topics to finish them quickly or just sometimes due to being behind. 
Some cases I move on through content before I have fully understood it, thus making later topics more of a struggle to learn.
Slowing down and experimenting to consolidate my understanding will help me, especially in the long run.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Seeing real-world examples or little projects that use concepts taught in the subject,
knowing the context behind why and how what we do is used would be very interesting.
